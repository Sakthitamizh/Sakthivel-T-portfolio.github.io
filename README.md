Hello,
I am Sakthivel Tamilselvan from Coimbatore. I have completed Bsc Computer science in 2013. I have worked as Admin cum accountant in two companies for the past 9.5 years. 
I wanted to switch my career so I chose to complete a professional course. 
I left the job in March 2023 and I have decided to go with Google Data analytics certification and successfully completed it within 6 months. 
Also, I have completed various courses like Advanced Excel, Data visualization with PowerBI and Advanced SQL courses and more to upgrade my skills.
I have knowledge and experience in skills like Excel, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, PPTS, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning.
Recently I have completed one-month Internship at Mentorness. Now I am ready to showcase my skills at real time projects. I am always keen to learn new technologies and upgrade myself.
